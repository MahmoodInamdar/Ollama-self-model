# Ollama-self-model

I built a custom code-generation model using Ollama, creating a tailored Modelfile to fine-tune and serve the model locally. This setup enables efficient, on-device inference for AI-assisted coding, optimizing performance and response times. By leveraging Ollamaâ€™s flexible model serving, I achieved a seamless workflow for code generation, completion, and AI-driven software development. ðŸš€
